<h3>Introduction</h3>
This project is going to be a central place for missing people around the country. It is in the beggining
stages. I am using webscrapers to get information on as many missing people as I can possible find. I will 
also connect to to the Doe Network, where we will be able to compare sketches to photos of missing people
in hopes to possible match an overlooked person. 

<h3>Mission</h3> 
The mission of this application is to generate exposure for missing people in hope to bring them home.
