A deceased baby girl infant was found inside the backpack. It?s estimated the infant had been deceased less than 24 hours. Forensic testing suggests she was Hispanic. Authorities identified a medication in her blood that treats epileptic seizures or different mood disorders in adults. It is believed that the infant?s mother was taking this medication during pregnancy. The level detected was a standard prescribed amount.  Inside the backpack authorities also found a red bath towel, a brown bathmat and matching brown toilet seat cover. Pollen testing of the evidence suggest that the items spent a significant amount of time in an urban area of Northern Illinois and possibly originated in the Southwest United States before coming to Illinois. The images featured are of the items discovered with the infant.",

It is unknown how long the skull had been at that location but it is estimated that the child had been deceased at least one year before being found. An anthropologist examined the skull and estimates that the child was 8-13 years old. Sex could not be determined. The lower jaw was not recovered with the skull but an exam of the upper teeth did not find any evidence of dental fillings or orthodontic work. The anthropologist noted the child was likely of Mestizo ancestry which is an admixture of Native American, Hispanic, Latino and Mexican. The above images are a facial reconstruction completed by a NCMEC Forensic Artist that depicts what the child may have looked like in life. The artist used the skull to create two images of the child. One that depicts the child as a female and the other as a male. Since the lower jaw was not recovered the jaw is the artist?s interpretation and only an approximation.",

        "details": "Skeletal remains of a little girl were found on January 28, 2012 at a trailer park on Hurst Street in Opelika, Alabama which falls in Lee County. It?s estimated the child had been deceased between 8 months and 2 years placing date of death between 2010 ? 2012. She is estimated to be 3-7 years old and had medium length black hair styled in small tight curls. Her height, weight, and eye color cannot be determined. An anthropological assessment of her bones suggest she had likely been abused and malnourished in life. A long-sleeve pink shirt with heart buttons and small ruffles near the neckline was recovered near the skeletal remains but it is unknown if it belonged to the child. Chemical isotope testing on her bones suggest she was born and raised in Alabama or one of the surrounding southern states. The images above are a facial reconstruction completed by a NCMEC Forensic Artist and depict what the child may have looked like in life.",

It is suspected the individual died between 2001 and 2008.  The decedent is believed to have been between 16 and 25 years of age and was possibly Native American or of an admixed race.  Gender, hair color, eye color, height and weight are all unknown.  The featured images are facial reconstructions completed by a NCMEC Forensic Artist that depict what the child may have looked like in life. The artist used images of the cranium to create two images of the child: one that depicts the child as a female and the other as a male. Since the lower jaw was not recovered the jawline is the artist's interpretation and only an approximation.  Anyone with information should contact the Pima County Office of the Medical Examiner, reference case number ML11-01862.",

It is estimated that she had been deceased for several months prior to being found and likely died during the Summer or Fall of 2008. The Jane Doe is 15-21 years old and thought to be Caucasian, but Hispanic and Native American cannot be ruled out. She had long light brown to dark blond hair. She stood between 4?10?-5?04? tall and weighed between 110-135 pounds. Her teeth were in good condition with good alignment. She had fillings in four of her bottom molars. Anthropological examination also revealed that she had Spina Bifida Occulta, but possibly never knew she had this condition. It is also suggested that she might have been knock kneed or pigeon toed, where her feet turned slightly inward. A well healed fracture to one of her left ribs was also found suggesting she suffered some type of injury earlier in life. The Jane Doe was found wearing a black shirt (size small) and jeans (size 3) as pictured above. The clothing was most likely purchased at a Family Dollar Store or general retailer. The first three images above are a reconstruction completed by a NCMEC Forensic Artist and shows what the female may have looked like while alive.",

An anthropological assessment determined the child is of mixed ancestry, showing both black and white traits. Only the cranium was recovered, no other bones including the mandible have been found. The image shown is a facial reconstruction completed by a NCMEC Forensic Artist and depicts what the male may have looked like in life. While the mandible was not recovered, the artist was able to utilize a suitable match to complete the reconstruction. The lower half of his mouth down to his chin is an approximation by the artist.",

It was estimated that he was in his late teens to very early twenties, stood between 5?1\" and 5?3\" tall, and weighed 135 lbs.  Earlier in life, the male had broken his nose and right big toe.  The male had two homemade stippled tattoos.  One of them was on his left hand between his thumb and pointer finger and depicted the letters \"UL\".  The other tattoo which was found on his forearm was illegible.  The male was found wearing a black short sleeved shirt with the letter \"Z\" and a Starter Brand logo on the front.  He was also wearing brown corduroy pants with a black webbed belt, brown socks, and white NIKE shoes.  The shoes had blue accents and had blue and white soles with the word \"Flight\" written on the side.  A red BIC lighter was also found in the male?s pocket.  An anthropological assessment of his bones showed that he may have had poor nutrition or chronic sickness during childhood, and he may have been a migrant worker who grew up outside of the United States.  The image above is a facial reconstruction completed by a NCMEC Forensic Artist and depicts what the male may have looked like in life.  Two images are renderings of the tattoos on his hand and arm.

The Jane Doe is believed to have been between 16 and 20 years of age and was Native American or Caucasian.  She was approximately 5'3\" and had long dark brown hair, approximately 10 inches in length.  The Jane Doe either had a child or had carried a child to term.  All of her teeth were present with no dental work.  The skeletal remains of a horse were located nearby.  An ankle length skirt, black in color with white designs throughout, was recovered among the horse bones.  The skirt was one size fits all and \"Countess\" brand.  Another piece of cloth, black with white polka dots, was located nearby.  The material appears to be a wrap-around blouse of mid-length that buttoned in the front.  Two pads were recovered that appear to be shoulder pads from the blouse.  A black bra, black panties and a piece of black denim were also located.  Among the remains was a pink and green comforter with a floral design and two baby blankets.  One baby blanket was blue, white and pink in color and the other was pink and had been tied to the comforter on one corner.  The featured reconstruction is an artist's rendering of what the Jane Doe may have looked like.

He was found wearing a pair of dark colored jeans, with approximate 30\" waist, jockey style underwear, and dark colored wingtip shoes size 9 1/2. The brand of shoes were the \"Leather Collection\" which was sold by Payless Shoes. A 1985 five cent U.S. coin was also found with the male. The anthropological exam also revealed the skeleton was particularly robust for a male of this age noting characteristics that were consistent with an occupation of a laborer.

It is also noted that she had Spina bifida occulta, however the female may not have been aware of this or portrayed any outward symptoms. The female had seen a dentist in life as evidenced by several dental fillings; however overall she had poor dental hygiene. Several cavities had started, tooth loose, periodontal disease and an abscess towards the bottom right of her jaw was noted. The female was found clothed wearing a large white t-shirt with the ?New York Giants? logo along with the ?Super Bowl Champions XXV? on the front with teal colored shorts. Underneath she wore a one piece light blue bathing suite.  She also had on a pair of white Gitano Casuals brand sandals, size 8 as pictured above. The female also wore several pieces of jewelry including earrings and three rings. The female had three piercings in each ear and wore the hoop earrings that are depicted above. One of the 14K gold rings was worn on her left ring finger. A second ring was gold with the center stone setting empty and the third was a gold AVON ring with a clear center stone. The female also wore fake fingernails on both hands. The images above are a facial reconstruction completed by a NCMEC Forensic Artist and depicts what she may have looked like in life.",

The male?s nose appeared slightly crooked and may have tilted to the right. Characteristics of the leg bones suggested he may have had some type of gait disturbance. The male?s lower jaw was not recovered. An exam of the upper teeth suggested that he may have endured some type of trauma to his face prior to his death that formed an abscess behind his front upper teeth. This may have caused him some pain or discomfort. The male was found wearing Levi Straus blue jeans, size 30M with a belt that had a white metal buckle.

She had been deceased for 3-6 weeks. The female is estimated to be in her late teens to early twenties. She had dark brown, shoulder length hair, stood between 4?11?-5?05? and weighed 100-110 pounds. An anthropological assessment suggests the female was of European or mixed ancestry with an appearance of Hispanic. It is also noted that she had Spina bifida occulta, however the female may not have been aware of this or portrayed any outward symptoms. The female had seen a dentist in life as evidenced by several dental fillings; however overall she had poor dental hygiene. Several cavities had started, tooth loose, periodontal disease and an abscess towards the bottom right of her jaw was noted. The female was found clothed wearing a large white t-shirt with the ?New York Giants? logo along with the ?Super Bowl Champions XXV? on the front with teal colored shorts. Underneath she wore a one piece light blue bathing suite.  She also had on a pair of white Gitano Casuals brand sandals, size 8 as pictured above. The female also wore several pieces of jewelry including earrings and three rings. The female had three piercings in each ear and wore the hoop earrings that are depicted above. One of the 14K gold rings was worn on her left ring finger. A second ring was gold with the center stone setting empty and the third was a gold AVON ring with a clear center stone. The female also wore fake fingernails on both hands. The images above are a facial reconstruction completed by a NCMEC Forensic Artist and depicts what she may have looked like in life.",

The male?s nose appeared slightly crooked and may have tilted to the right. Characteristics of the leg bones suggested he may have had some type of gait disturbance. The male?s lower jaw was not recovered. An exam of the upper teeth suggested that he may have endured some type of trauma to his face prior to his death that formed an abscess behind his front upper teeth. This may have caused him some pain or discomfort. The male was found wearing Levi Straus blue jeans, size 30M with a belt that had a white metal buckle.

Her race is unknown however her brown hair is microscopically similar to head hairs from known Admixed AmerIndians.

A Phoenix Transit System token inscribed with the words \"Valid for one student fare\" was located in her left front pants pocket.  A round piece of paper the size of a penny was found in her left front pants pocket.  The paper had a figure of Abraham Lincoln on one side and the Lincoln Memorial on the other side, both in green ink.  The Jane Doe was also found wearing a yellow metal ring with a nugget design on her left ring finger.  She had no obvious dental care and her teeth were described as \"protruding\".

An anthropological assessment of the female?s bones showed a healed fracture on the left side of her nose.  She may also have had an old healed injury to her right knee.  The female's first molar on the lower right side had been removed earlier in life. She also had a pronounced overbite (buck teeth).  No personal items or clothing were found with the female.

It is estimated that she died shortly before her body was discovered. The female is estimated to be in her late teens or twenties. She has shoulder length dark brown wavy hair. She has a dark, olive skin complexion. A homemade tattoo was found on her upper right arm, near her shoulder, of two letters that were difficult to decipher but could be the letters ?JP?. She also has a one and half inch scar on her right thigh and her ears are pierced. Her teeth were well cared for by a dentist as some fillings were observed and several molars had been extracted earlier in life. The female was found clothed, wearing a white short sleeved sweater, Levi brand yellowish-beige jeans, a white bra, and dark colored striped knee socks. A light brown leather shoe with twine used as a shoelace was found nearby and suspected to have been worn by the female. She also wore a thin leather string necklace with a turquoise blue bead attached around her neck. Inside her pant pocket two brass keys were found attached to a safety pin. The investigation and forensic testing completed on some of the items recovered with the female suggest that she came from an urban area in the Northeastern United States, with a specific focus on Boston, MA or New York City. The images shown are a facial reconstruction completed by a NCMEC Forensic Artist and depicts what the female may have looked like in life. Digitally enhanced images of the necklace and shoe recovered with the female are also displayed above.",

This places time of death in the Spring through early Fall of 1974. Bones of a puppy were also found near the Jane Doe. She is 15-25 years old. She is estimated to have stood around 5?04\" tall and weighed 132 pounds. She had black hair. The Jane Doe had healed rib fractures from a previous injury that occurred earlier in life. No evidence of cavities or restorations were found in the recovered teeth but she did have an extra tooth on the top right side of her jaw. A red shell blouse, flowered blue slacks, a bra, female underpants, and black Italian made wedge shoes were found with her remains. The images above were created by a NCMEC Forensic Artist. It is a reconstruction of what the female may have looked like in life.",

He had brown hair approximately 7 inches in length (from the crown). He was found with belted ?Catalina? swim trunks with vertical red, turquoise, gold, and dark blue stripes, with the letter ?C? on the silver buckle (shown above) and a khaki-colored long sleeved t-shirt that tied in the front. The shirt had a large blue and white peace symbol and the letters ?USMC?, and ?L84MF? written underneath the peace symbol. He was also found with dark blue corduroys with a 32 inch waist and a 30 inch inseam, a knotted leather ankle bracelet, and brown leather cowboy boots that were 12 inches in length and had the word ?NEOLITE? on the heel.  Examination revealed that the boy had a mild form of spina bifida which may have caused him lower back pain or possibly affected his stride; however, it may not have produced any noticeable symptoms.

The female had been deceased for several months prior to being found. The female is estimated to be 12-18 years old but likely on the younger side closer to age of 12-14. She was petite at about 5?02? tall and around 115 pounds. Her hair was possibly auburn and shoulder length. She was found wearing a blue polo shirt, bell bottom slacks with multiple colored vertical stripes, and brown leather sandals. She also wore a wide leather band bracelet with small brass eyelets all around the band. Attached to the bracelet through some of the eyelets was a small watch. The watch did not appear to have been originally attached to the leather band but secured separately. Inside the female's pants was a key to a local motel along the Garden State Parkway. The images above is an enhanced photograph of the bracelet the female was wearing along with a facial reconstruction completed by a NCMEC Forensic Artist and another one completed by a NJSP Forensic Artist. Both reconstructions depict what the female may have looked like in life.",
